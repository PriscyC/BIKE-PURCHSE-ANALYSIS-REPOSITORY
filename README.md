EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE BIKE PURCHSE DATASET

This report analyzes a dataset containing demographic, economic, and lifestyle information on 1,026 individuals. 
The dataset includes variables such as marital status,
gender, income, education, occupation, home ownership, region, and whether individuals have purchased a bike. 
The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and correlations within the data to better understand the factors that influence income and consumer behavior,
particularly in relation to bike purchases. Checkout the full analysis process in the notebook.
