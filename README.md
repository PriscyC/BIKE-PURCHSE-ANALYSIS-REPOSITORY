# TECHSTUDIO ACADEMY TASKS REPOSITORY

This repository contains the tasks I have undertaken in the course of my internship at TechStudio so far. Excel for two (2) projects can be found here.

# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE BIKE PURCHSE DATASET

The first project showcases an exploratory data analysis of a bike dataset containing demographic, economic, and lifestyle information on 1,026 individuals. 
The dataset includes variables such as marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, home ownership, region, and whether individuals have purchased a bike. 
The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and correlations within the data to better understand the factors that influence income and consumer behavior,
particularly in relation to bike purchases. Checkout the full analysis process in the notebook.

# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE FLIGHT DATASET

The second dataset in this repository captures the analysis by using pivot to highlight key financial and operational data for each airline. 
Airline A and C lead in revenue, and the ticket prices show significant variation across different routes. 
The analysis of average flight durations provides insights into the operational efficiency of different routes. 
Peak passenger months, ticket prices, and flight counts indicate important trends in airlineÂ performance.
